# Monty-Hall-Problem

This code generates 10,000 simulations of the famed Monty Hall problem and records the results under two strategies: (1) always switching doors and (2) never switching doors. The code outputs three charts: the cumulative wins over time, the cumulative winning percentage over time, and the end winning percentage under each strategy. While other similiar repos to this exist, a useful component of this is that it records outcomes of the same game under different strategies, rather than different games under different strategies.
